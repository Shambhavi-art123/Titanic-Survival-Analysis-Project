# Titanic-Survival-Analysis-Project
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival based on various features such as gender, class, age, and more. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to understand survival patterns.

Project Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends and patterns in the dataset.
Machine Learning Models: Built predictive models to estimate passenger survival.
Utility Functions: Includes helper scripts for reusable functionality.
